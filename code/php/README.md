# PHP

Under Linux, open a shell, use your Linux Package Manager (apt, apt-get, yum, etc.) 
to install PHP, and execute `./run`.

Under Windows, download [PHP for Windows, Non Thread Safe](https://windows.php.net/download/),
open a command prompt, and execute:
<pre>
path %path%;"&lt;path to 'php.exe'&gt;"
run
</pre>
