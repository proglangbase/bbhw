# PHP

`./run` will execute `ghw.php` in Linux. If it fails, use your Linux Package Manager 
(apt, apt-get, yum, etc.) to install PHP and try again.

`run` will execute `ghw.php` in Windows. If it fails, download [PHP for Windows, Non Thread Safe](https://windows.php.net/download/)  
and execute:
<pre>
  path %path%;"&lt;path to 'php.exe'&gt;"
  run
</pre>
