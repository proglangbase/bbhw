# Common Lisp

[Common Lisp] is a dialect of [Lisp], the first high-level [Functional Programming] 
language and one of the oldest languages still in common use, today. The name 
***Lisp*** is derived from **"LISt Processor"** and all program code is written 
as `(parenthesized lists (with operators and operands) (separated by spaces))`.

Common Lisp was first developed in 1984 and became an ANSI standard Lisp version 
in 1994.
